# Shuffle_Animation

This is a video with background colors that don’t change: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Pn3yz9B_KfM.
Want to make it change background colors on the beat? Example: https://youtu.be/l4Gm8kdurlI.

Run `shuffle_animation.ipynb`, then `images_to_video.ipynb`. As you can tell by the filenames, this code isn’t meant to be easy for the general public to use. I call a file `shuffle_animation` because I’m animating over someone shuffling. You’re gonna have to change the names of the video and audio files. I currently lack incentive to make an app for the general public. I commented on my code, but I probably could comment more. Everything I write/code isn’t as concise nor logical as it could be.

If you want to store a Github repo on Google Drive and code in Google Colab (a website), follow this tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/google-drive-google-colab-github-dont-just-read-do-it-5554d5824228

The code doesn’t take too long to run. The longest time it took to run a cell was about 4  minutes.
